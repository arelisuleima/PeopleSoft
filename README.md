1. Im not a expert in PeopleSoft and maybe some of my activities are very ugly(in the programming aspect👩‍💻), so if something are very bad please tell me or tweet me something funny.

2. ***Key Concepts***

**Application Designer**: A metadata-driven interactive development environment (IDE) used to customize PeopleSoft applications.
It enables you to perform numerous development tasks, including:
- Create and modify definition of fields and records.
- Create and run SQL scripts that create and modify tables and indexes.
- Create and debug PeopleCode. (Here allows my dumb code lol😒) 
- Create and modify pages for the user interface.
- Create and modify components (groups of pages).
- Work with style sheets to customize the appearance of applications.
- Upgrade your existing applications to the latest versions of PeopleSoft.

It allows us to create:
- Fields
- Records (Tables)
- Pages
- Components
- Menus
- People code
-SQL

***Soon updates 🙃***
